# FoundryVTT - Elemental (Unofficial) system

This is an unofficial foundry system for the Elemental RPG from Gildor Games.

# Features

This is still a work in progress and far from complete, but it can be playable.
You can make characters with skills and attributes, make rolls, give your characters conditions, ...

Lots of things are missing, mainly:
- Items (of any kind)
- Damage (you must manually add and subtract it)
- Powers (although you can approximate then with skills)
- Flaws
- Archetypes
- Superpowers

# Contributing

Any kind of contribution is accepted and wellcome.

This project uses [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) as a css framework. If you want to change anything related to it, please familiarize yourself with it before.
As a result there are 3 css files, please add your own styles to `elemental.css` as the other two are used to generate the tailwind output.

This projects also uses github actions for release. Any change to CHANGELOG.MD will trigger a release. So no need to add your changes to that file, just use clear, descriptive commit messages.
