# FoundryVTT - Elemental (Unofficial) system

This is an unofficial foundry system for the Elemental RPG from Gildor Games.

# Features

This is still a work in progress and far from complete, but it can be playable.
You can make characters with skills and attributes, make rolls, give your characters conditions, ...

Lots of things are missing, mainly:
- Items (of any kind)
- Damage (you must manually add and subtract it)
- Powers (although you can approximate then with skills)
- Flaws
- Archetypes
- Superpowers
